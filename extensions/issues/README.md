# rawkode.issues

Per-repository issues for Tartan, written in **Rust and compiled to a WebAssembly component** (`tartan:ext@0.1.0`). It
is published and installed like any third-party package (`id` outside `tartan.*`, `runtime: "wasm"`, no permissions),
and runs as a Dynamic Worker facet of its installation's own Durable Object, with its own SQLite: `storage.scope:
"repo"`, so each repository has its own database and its own issue numbers (`#1`, `#2`, …). An issue may belong to a
project of the repository.

| Contribution        | Role      | What it does                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `repo.tab` `issues` | Reporter  | the Issues page: open and closed counts, the newest 100 issues, a "New issue" form   |
| action `create`     | Reporter  | the form's submit: opens an issue as the viewer, then a toast and a re-render        |
| tool `list`         | Reporter  | `state` (`open` by default, `closed`, `all`), `limit` 1–100 (30); no bodies          |
| tool `get`          | Reporter  | one issue by `number`, with its body                                                 |
| tool `create`       | Reporter  | `title` (one line, ≤ 200 characters), `body` (Markdown, ≤ 20000); the caller authors |
| tool `close`        | Developer | closes an issue by `number`; `changed: false` when it already was closed             |
| tool `reopen`       | Developer | reopens an issue by `number`; `changed: false` when it already was open              |
| `protocol.md`       |           | the MCP protocol card                                                                |

Over MCP the tools are `issues_list`, `issues_get`, `issues_create`, `issues_close` and `issues_reopen`. Opening an
issue is a Reporter action, like commenting: the host applies the tab's role to its form, so the `create` tool has the
same role. Changing an issue's state needs Developer and has no button in the tab yet, since a slot's actions all share
the slot's role. An issue's author is the actor the host gives the call (`kind` and `id`, and `on_behalf_of` for an
agent acting for a user).

## Projects

Every tool takes an optional `project` and every issue carries `project` (null for an issue of the whole repository). It
is the project's **root path** (`crates/lsp`), not its name, and it is stored as written when the issue is opened:

- `list` with `project` filters the issues and their counts to it, by exact root: a nested project's issues are its own.
- `create` files the issue against it. The tab's form files repo-wide issues and never reads `project`.
- `get`, `close` and `reopen` with `project` answer `not_found` for another project's issue. Without it they reach any
  issue in the repository.
- Without `project`, `list` is repo-wide: every issue, whichever project it belongs to.

The extension cannot see the project graph, so it checks only the path's shape. The kernel's JSON route
(`POST /-/api/repos/<repoId>/ext/rawkode.issues/tools/<tool>`, [docs/projects.md](../../docs/projects.md)) resolves a
project's name to its root, refuses an unknown one and refuses one that switched Issues off.

What follows from that, and is not handled:

- **Renaming a project keeps its issues; moving it does not.** A change to `name:` leaves the root alone. A moved
  directory is a new root, so its old issues stay filed under the old path: the project's list no longer shows them, and
  the project's `get`, `close` and `reopen` answer `not_found`. They still appear repo-wide. Nothing rewrites them, and
  no issue can be refiled.
- **A deleted project's issues stay** under its old path, and repo-wide.
- **Over MCP, `project` is not checked.** An MCP caller's string is stored as written, against any path or against a
  project with Issues switched off. The per-project switch scopes the JSON route only ([docs/projects.md](../../docs/projects.md)).

Layout: `src/issue.rs` (argument checks, JSON shapes and the tab document; pure), `src/store.rs` (the `issues` table),
`src/lib.rs` (the hooks), `migrations/` (`0002` adds the nullable `project` and its index), `protocol.md`, `tartan.json`.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path extensions/issues/Cargo.toml
deno task build:ext issues      # → extensions/issues/dist/ (never committed)
```

The build needs `wasm-tools` 1.248.0 (`cargo install --locked wasm-tools@1.248.0`, or `WASM_TOOLS`). The authoring guide
